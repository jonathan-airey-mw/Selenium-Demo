Selenium-Demo
=============

A simple selenium demo with some setup files to get you rolling.

To get this going you will want to copy the executable (IE,FF,CHROME) executables into the bin directory (in your debug/release folders or whatever else you may use). These are required to run the automation. 

This project is not meant to reflect best practices in coding but will demonstate some basic selenium features. The purpose is actually to highlight a couple of the features reguarding selecting elements. This is a very important of automated testing and when done poorly will be your downfall. The test wants to illustrate that writing tests with poorly devleoped selectors can lead to false positives as well as false negatives.
